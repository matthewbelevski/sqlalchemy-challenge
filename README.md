# sqlalchemy-challenge

For this challenge the goal was to import an sqlite database into pandas using sqlalchemy and then perform analysis on the data.

This included creating queries in order to filter the data as well as to perform functions to find values such as the min, max or avg.

Taking this a step further, the task was then to convert this query to a dataframe in order to plot it as either a histogram or bar chart.

The next task was to create a Flask API based on the same sqlite database and queries as above. This Flask API was required to have 6 Routes performing differenct functions which included filtering by date or date range or having to find the most active station as two examples.
